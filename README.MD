## Coding Club Meeting #5
This is the solution to the problem I have asked in class, although students were not expected to provide an answer. Either way this more serves a really basic guide to file handling.
### The fun doesn't stop here
This is an _ok_ txt to csv converter, but there are some improvements you could make, consider the following:
- This program lacks a way to input names, how would you do that whilst still outputing a _.txt_ file?
- What fixes would you make to allow this program to handle people with Multiple Middle and Last Names? (Not even I have a practical approach for this, which doesn't involve directly asking the user)
- You could also try organizing people into families and such depending on their last name. 
If you are running VCode (or figure out how Git compatibility works with Replit), feel free to upload any changes to the _test_ branch.
